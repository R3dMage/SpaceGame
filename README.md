# SpaceGame
A simple space shooter to help me learn about using Javascript and canvas rendering

## Description
You start off as a little ship and have to shoot enemies to kill them before they kill you. And you know, collect power ups on the way

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
You need a web browser.
I think I wanna add some PHP stuff at some point. Hopefully I'll update the readme if I do that.
